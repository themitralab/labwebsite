# Open positions


We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc

We are happy to support talented master and recent PhD graduates to apply for Ph.D and Postdoc fellowships in the group. Please contact us if would like to follow this route in joining the lab ([email](mailto:suman.mitra@inserm.fr")). 

### Bsc / Master students
Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation).
