- title: "IL-2 is inactivated by the acidic pH environment of tumors enabling engineering of a pH-selective mutein"
  image: sciimmunol.2022.7.issue-78.largecover.png
  description: Cytokines are extremely sensitive to the acidic pH found in tumors and lymph nodes. The activity of IL-2, a cytokine central to T cell responses, is highly limited at acidic pH. Using in vitro evolution, a new IL-2 variant, Switch-2, was developped. It exhibits enhanced activity at acidic pH but, exhibits reduced activity at the neutral pH found in healthy tissue. Switch-2 therapy in mice triggered potent antitumor responses while avoiding the severe systemic toxicity associated with IL-2 therapies.

  description: This work presents a flexible, precise, and efficient selection strategy to engineer cells using CRISPR-Cas and base editing systems. The method enables the rapid generation of a homogenous cell population with bi-allelic integration of a DNA casette at the selection locus, without clonal isolation.

- title: "LDH Inhibition and IL-21 Synergistically Promote CD8+ T Stemness and Antitumor Immunity."
  image: LDH_PNAS.png
  description: LDH inhibition enhanced the generation of memory cells capable of triggering robust antitumor responses after adoptive transfer. Combined with IL-21, LDH inhibition resulted in more profound antitumor responses and prolonged host survival. This underscores the therapeutic potential of transiently inhibiting LDH during adoptive T cell-base immunotherapy, with an unanticipated cooperative anti-tumor effect of LDH inhibition and IL-21.

  description: Cytokines activate signaling via assembly of cell surface receptors. Engineered IL-6 variants with different affinities to gp130 induced biased signaling, with changes in receptor binding dwell-times affecting more profoundly STAT1 than STAT3 phosphorylation. This demonstrate that manipulation of signaling thresholds is a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy.
