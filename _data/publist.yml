- title: "Universal toxin-based selection for precise genome engineering in human cells."
  image: toxin_Nature_communications_pic.png
  description: This work presents a flexible, precise, and efficient selection strategy to engineer cells using CRISPR-Cas and base editing systems. The method enables the rapid generation of a homogenous cell population with bi-allelic integration of a DNA casette at the selection locus, without clonal isolation.

  description: A review about the complex functions of myeloid-derived cytokines in both supporting and suppresing natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We present strategies using pathways involved in the NK-myeloid cell crosstalk in the TME to improve NK cell-base immunotherapies.

- title: "LDH Inhibition and IL-21 Synergistically Promote CD8+ T Stemness and Antitumor Immunity."
  image: LDH_PNAS.png
  description: LDH inhibition enhanced the generation of memory cells capable of triggering robust antitumor responses after adoptive transfer. Combined with IL-21, LDH inhibition resulted in more profound antitumor responses and prolonged host survival. This underscores the therapeutic potential of transiently inhibiting LDH during adoptive T cell-base immunotherapy, with an unanticipated cooperative anti-tumor effect of LDH inhibition and IL-21.

  description: This work presents a large whole-genome analysis of metastatic uveal melanoma. It highlights the role of BAP1 alteration as a riving event for uveal melanoma progression. Transcriptomic analysis showed a high expression of immune checkpoint receptors TIM-3, TIGIT and LAG3 in Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

- title: "Kinetics of cytokine receptor trafficking determine signaling and functional selectivity"
  image: Cytokine_kinetic_elife.png
  description: Cytokines activate signaling via assembly of cell surface receptors. Engineered IL-6 variants with different affinities to gp130 induced biased signaling, with changes in receptor binding dwell-times affecting more profoundly STAT1 than STAT3 phosphorylation. This demonstrate that manipulation of signaling thresholds is a useful strategy to decouple cytokine functional pleiotropy.
